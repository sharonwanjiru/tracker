# 1. Registrar
## Description
- A registration system for a multi-business.

## Problem
- Most of the registration systems of today are single-business oriented.
- There are scarcely any multi-businesses registration systems.

## Plan
- Simple registration and log in forms
- Registration to be one-time for users of sub-systems of the multi-business.
- Logging in to be user-centric that is, the user should be able to choose which system of the multi-business that they want to interact with.
- Proper record-keeping of users of the sub-systems used by the multi-business

## Outcome 
- A working web application that allows registration of users in multi business scenario
