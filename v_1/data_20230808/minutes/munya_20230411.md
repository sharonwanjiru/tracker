## Database Modelling

### Structure

mobile

- code : string(3)254
- num : string(10)
- primary:tinyint:null

member

- name:string(10)
- fullname:string(50)

membership(abstract table)

- startdate : datetime
- enddate : datetime

Beneficiary

- no attribute, it has two links one to membership and contributor
- It has identifiers: which member?, what is the contribution
- beneficiary is different from contributor

Contribution

-amount:number
-mpesacode

- to uniquely identify a contribution, you use the event.The event is not sufficient hence you need also a member.MpesaCode is not suitable because a person can have two contributions e.g 250 today and 250 tomorrow(rare case).

Contributor

- Just like the beneficiary ,it links to membership

Event

- name
- description
- date
  - the event is linked to the contribution
  - One event can have many contributions
