    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p data-problem>
        Real-time communication between users has been a problem with the Mutall 
        Outlook/Schema Library.With WebSockets, as a compliment to the existing 
        messaging system .i.e, the Mutall Messaging and Emailing System.The 
        development of the Chat System will enable real time communication and 
        an application that will Rival WhatsApp.
    </p>
    <h2>Plan</h2>
    <p data-plan>
        Develop a Chat System so well established that it will compete with 
        WhatsApp and our users will instead use the Mutall Chat(For lack of a 
        better naming) instead.
